# Python Essentials 1: Module 1

## Introduction to Python and Computer Programming

In this module, you will learn about:
- Fundamentals of computer programming.
- The difference between compilation and interpretation.
- The distinction between different versions of Python.

## Linguistics

- The **syntax** of a programming language describes which character strings constitute a valid program.
- The **semantics** of a programming language describes what syntactically valid programs mean.
- Syntax concerns the form of the language, semantics concerns the meaning.
- The **lexicon** is simply the set of all the words and expressions of the language, and these words or expressions are called lexical elements.

  **Example:**
    - *Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.*

## Python Language Trivia:
- **Guido Van Rossum** (Creator of Python): the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called *Monty Python's Flying Circus*.

## Key Concepts:
**Compiled vs Interpreted Languages**:
  - **Compiled languages** convert code into machine language before execution.
  - **Interpreted languages** execute code line-by-line during runtime.

- **Syntax vs Semantics**:
  - **Syntax**: Rules governing the structure of valid programs.
  - **Semantics**: What the syntactically correct program means or does.

- **Python Versions**:
  - **CPython**: Standard Python interpreter.
  - **Cython**: Extension for compiling Python code to C.
  - **Jython**: Python implemented in Java.
  - **PyPy**: Python interpreter written in RPython (a Python subset).
