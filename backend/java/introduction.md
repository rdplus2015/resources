## Hello world
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### The `main` Method

The `main` method is a special method in Java that serves as the entry point for any standalone Java application. It is where the program begins execution.

- **`public`**: The method must be accessible from outside its class, hence it is `public`.
- **`static`**: The method is static, meaning it belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. This is necessary because the method is called by the JVM without creating an instance of the class.
- **`void`**: The method does not return any value.
- **`main`**: This is the name of the method, which is predefined by the JVM as the entry point of the program.
- **`String[] args`**: The method takes a single argument: an array of `String` objects. This array can hold any command-line arguments that are passed when the program is run.

### `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`

This line prints the string `"Hello, World!"` to the console. 

- **`System`**: A class in the `java.lang` package.
- **`out`**: A static member of the `System` class, which is an instance of `PrintStream`. It's used to output text to the console.
- **`println`**: A method of the `PrintStream` class that prints the specified string followed by a newline character.

### Why is the `main` Method Important?

The `main` method is crucial because it is the starting point of every Java application. Without it, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) wouldn't know where to begin executing the program, and the application wouldn't run.

## Java Essentials: Quotes, Comments, and New Lines

## Quotes

- **Double Quotes (`"`)**: For `String` literals.
```java
  String message = "Hello, World!";
```

- **Single Quotes (`'`)**: For `char` literals.
```java
char letter = 'A';
```
- **Incorrect Usage**:
```java
String message = 'Hello, World!'; // Error: incompatible types
char letter = "A"; // Error: incompatible types
char emptyChar = ''; // Error: empty character literal
```
## Comments

-   **Single-Line Comments**:
```java
// Comment
int number = 10; // Inline comment
```
- **Multi-Line Comments**:
```java 
/*
 * Multi-line comment
 */
int number = 10;
```
- **Documentation Comments**:
```java
/**
 * Documentation comment
 */
public class Example {
    // Code
}
```
## New Lines

-   **Using `\n`**: Adds a new line in strings.
```java
System.out.println("Hello,\nWorld!");
```
- **Using `System.out.println()`**: Adds a new line automatically.
```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

# Java API: Key Concepts

## What is an API in Java?

The Java API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of classes, interfaces, and libraries that allow Java developers to interact with the system or an application without needing to understand its internal details. This simplifies application development by reusing already written functionalities.

## Components of the Java API

The Java API is divided into several components:

- **Classes**: They represent objects and provide reusable functionality. For example, the `String` class for manipulating text.
  
- **Interfaces**: These define methods without implementing them. Classes that implement an interface provide their own implementation. For example, the `List` interface is implemented by `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.

- **Methods**: Blocks of code that perform a specific action. For example, the `add()` method in the `ArrayList` class adds an element to the list.

- **Packages**: Packages organize classes and interfaces into logical groups. For example:
  - `java.lang`: Core classes like `String`, `Math`, `Object`.
  - `java.util`: Utility classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Date`.
  - `java.io`: Classes for input/output operations like `File`, `InputStream`.

## Why use the Java API?

- **Reusability**: You donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel for common functionalities like handling collections or file manipulation.
- **Portability**: Java is designed to be portable. By using the API, you ensure your code is compatible across platforms that support Java.
- **Standardization**: The Java API follows well-established standards, making code easier to maintain and understand.

## Major Java APIs

1. **Java Standard Edition (Java SE)**: It contains the core libraries of the Java language. For example:
   - **Collections API**: To manage data structures like lists, sets, and maps (`List`, `Set`, `Map`).
   - **Streams API**: To perform operations on data streams (`InputStream`, `OutputStream`).
   - **Concurrency API**: To manage multithreading and asynchronous operations.

2. **Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)**: Used to develop enterprise-level applications, it includes features like:
   - **Servlet API**: To handle HTTP requests in web applications.
   - **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For database management.

3. **JavaFX API**: For building rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

4. **Spring Framework** (third-party API): Although not included in Java SE/EE, it is widely used for developing Java applications, providing features for dependency injection, transaction management, and more.

## Benefits of the Java API

-   **Abstraction**: The API hides complex internal details, allowing you to focus on business logic.
-   **Large Ecosystem**: Java offers a vast set of standardized APIs for a variety of applications.
-   **Community Support**: A large community supports the development of new libraries and frameworks compatible with the Java API.
