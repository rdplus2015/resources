# Java Keywords: `static`, `final`, Constants, and Enums

## 1. `static` Keyword

In Java, the `static` keyword indicates that a member (variable or method) belongs to the **class itself** rather than to instances of the class. Here's why this matters:

- **Class-level scope**: A `static` member is shared across all instances of the class. All instances can access the same `static` variable or method.
- **No need for an object**: Static methods and variables can be accessed directly via the class name without creating an instance of the class.

### Example: Static Method (`main` Method)
When the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts an application, it looks for an entry point, which is the `main` method. To allow the JVM to invoke this method without creating an instance of the class, `main` is defined as `static`.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

In this example, the JVM can call `Main.main(...)` directly because `main` is `static`.

## 2. Constants in Java

In Java, constants are typically declared using both the `static` and `final` keywords:
- **`static`**: Ensures that the constant is shared among all instances, making it accessible without instantiation.
- **`final`**: Prevents reassignment, so the value remains unchanged once assigned.

### Conventions and Best Practices
- **Uppercase Naming**: Constants are named in uppercase letters with underscores (`_`) separating words.
- **Code Readability**: Constants make code easier to read and maintain, centralizing fixed values for easy modification.
- **Static Import**: By importing a `static` constant from another class, it can be used without prefixing it with the class name.

```java
public class Constants {
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;
    public static final String APP_NAME = "MyApp";
}
```

In this example, `PI` and `APP_NAME` are constants that can be accessed with `Constants.PI` and `Constants.APP_NAME`.

#### Example of Static Import
Using `import static`, you can access a constant directly without specifying its class:

```java
import static Constants.PI;

public class Circle {
    public double getArea(double radius) {
        return PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Using Constants
- **Improved Readability**: By using descriptive constant names, you make your code clearer and more understandable.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changing a constant value is straightforward since it’s defined in a single location.

## 3. Enums in Java

`Enums` are special classes in Java that represent a fixed set of constants. They are particularly useful for representing a limited set of values that a variable can take, such as days of the week or states in a process.

### Key Characteristics of `Enum`
- **Fixed Values**: An `enum` represents a finite set of constant values.
- **Compile-time Error Checking**: Using `enum` helps capture errors at compile time by restricting values to the defined set.

### Syntax of `Enum`

```java
public enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}
```

Here, `Day` is an `enum` type with seven constants.

### Example: Using `Enum`

An `enum` can be used to control the flow in a program based on a variable’s value. This is more readable and reliable than using raw integer values.

```java
public class EnumExample {
    public enum Day {
        MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
    }

    public static void printMessage(Day day) {
        switch (day) {
            case MONDAY:
                System.out.println("Start of the week!");
                break;
            case FRIDAY:
                System.out.println("Almost weekend!");
                break;
            case SUNDAY:
                System.out.println("Rest day!");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Just another day.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Enum with Custom Properties
Enums can also include custom properties and methods if additional information is required for each constant.

```java
public enum Severity {
    LOW(1), MEDIUM(2), HIGH(3);

    private final int level;

    private Severity(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    public int getLevel() {
        return level;
    }
}
```

In this example, each `Severity` constant has an associated integer level, which can be accessed with `getLevel()`.

## Summary

- **`static`**: Denotes class-level members, shared across all instances.
- **Constants**: Declared with `static final`, constants are class-level, immutable values, typically named in uppercase.
- **Enums**: Represents a fixed set of constants and is ideal for values that don’t change and are predefined, such as days of the week.

By understanding and properly using `static`, `final`, constants, and `enum`, you make your Java code more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
